 ## Problem Statement

Create a Tic Tac Toe app that can be played with a person. The app should be built using Flask and should include the following features:

* A user interface that allows two players to play a game of Tic Tac Toe.
* A game engine that keeps track of the game state and determines the winner.
* A way for players to chat with each other during the game.

## Design

The app will consist of the following HTML files:

* `index.html`: The main page of the app. This page will contain the game board and the chat window.
* `game.html`: A page that displays the current game state. This page will be updated whenever a player makes a move.
* `chat.html`: A page that displays the chat window. This page will be updated whenever a player sends a message.

The app will also have the following routes:

* `/`: The main page of the app.
* `/game`: The game page.
* `/chat`: The chat page.
* `/api/move`: An API endpoint that allows players to make moves.
* `/api/chat`: An API endpoint that allows players to send messages.

## Implementation

The app can be implemented using the following steps:

1. Create a new Flask app.
2. Add the HTML files to the app.
3. Add the routes to the app.
4. Implement the game engine.
5. Implement the chat feature.
6. Test the app.

## Deployment

The app can be deployed to a production environment using the following steps:

1. Create a new Heroku app.
2. Add the Flask app to the Heroku app.
3. Deploy the Heroku app.
4. Test the app in production.
